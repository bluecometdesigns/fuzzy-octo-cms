# Plan for next streams

_We_ need to finish this CMS at some point, so there's a list of features that I would like to see in this CMS. 

## Planned features

There are some features that I would like to implement in Fuzzy (funny name, huh?):

1. Extension API (modules and stuff)
2. Flexible content management
3. API for integrating different text formatters (markdown, textile, etc.)
4. Custom layouts and templates
5. Three CMS modes: dynamic, dynamic + cached, and static
6. More to come

## Feature request?

During streams you can request features, but it would be more helpful if you would document them and post in GitHub issues (with flag "feature request" in square brackets). 

If I will consider your feature useful or interesting, I might add it to the list, or, less possible, implement it as separate extension (see feature #1).
