# Plan for next streams

_We_ need to finish this CMS at some point, so there's a list of features that I would like to see in this CMS. 

## Planned features

There are some features that I would like to implement in Fuzzy (funny name, huh?):

- [x] API for integrating different text/config formatters (markdown, textile, etc.)
- [x] Extension API (modules and stuff)
- [x] Data files (custom data you can use anywhere)
- [x] Flexible content management
- [x] Custom layouts
- [ ] Browse content API
- [ ] Build static website out of `content` and of all the extensions (next stream)
- [ ] Ability to cache content into `db.sqlite` (next stream, probably)
- [ ] phar utility for building the CMS

More to come...

## Feature request?

During streams you can request features, but it would be more helpful if you would document them and post in GitHub issues (with flag "feature request" in square brackets). 

If I will consider your feature useful or interesting, I might add it to the list, or, less possible, implement it as separate extension (see feature #1).
